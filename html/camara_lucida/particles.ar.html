There are low-cost laptops for children to learn computation, but they are based on the personal computer + GUI model.
</p>

<p>
Transportable and low-cost devices are needed for children to learn Tangible-Computation based on the TUI model.
</p>

<p>
I foresee a computational artifact for the development of human creativity, expression, computational thinking and learning that bridges the digital and physical worlds.
</p>

<p>
Since "TUI serves as a special purpose interface for a specific application using explicit physical forms, while GUI serves as a general purpose interface..." (Ishii), then a device like this would need a certain degree of specificity for tangible-computation.
</p>

<p>
Then, my proposal is to make a device based on a specific physical system for learning specific computational concepts, which is the combination of: 
</p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li><p>Physical Building Blocks</p></li>
  <!--<p>+</p>-->
  <li><p>Particle System / Agent Based Models / Complex Adaptive Sytems / Swarm Intelligence</p></li>
  <!--<p>+</p>-->
  <li><p>3D Projector-Camera System</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
This is an interactive construction kit that combines agent-based modeling (ABM), complex adaptive systems (CAS) and swarm intelligence (SI) with physical building blocks. Simulations of autonomous agents are projected on top of objects using 3d camera-projector technology. 
</p>

<p>
This makes a playground for people to tinker with complex adaptive processes by means of constructing 3D structures in space with their own hands, and transforming low-cost materials in computational artifacts on-the-fly.
</p>

<p>
This learning tool can enable physical and ludic exploration of computational concepts from of agent-based systems and swarm intelligence like self-organization, emergence, decentralized decision making, collective behaviors, non-linearity, networks, evolution and adaptation.
