<h3>Interaction Design. Technology. Innovation.</h3>

<p>I build computational artifacts to expand the connections between people and technology. Tools for the development of human creativity, expression and learning from an approach that values play, creative problem solving and collaboration. I see the act of making digital artifacts as a creative process from a design perspective. I work through iterative cycles of action and reflection to build knowledge from experience and prototyping practices.</p>
