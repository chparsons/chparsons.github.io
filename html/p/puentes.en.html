Description
</h5>

<div>
"Puentes" is a computational construction kit for children to learn about complex adaptive systems through tinkering and physical play with a simulation of particles; develop creative problem-solving; and bridge the digital and physical worlds.
</div>

<h5>
Problem
</h5>

<div>
There are low-cost laptops for children to learn computation, but they are based on the personal computer (individual) and the GUI model (graphical user interface, purely digital, general purpose). Portable and low-cost devices are needed for children to develop creativity and systems thinking through Tangible-Computation based on a TUI model (tangible user interface, collaborative, hybrid physical-digital model of computation, special purpose).
</div>

<h5>
Solution
</h5>

<div>
A portable interactive construction kit made by the combination of: Building Blocks (Physical) + Autonomous Agents Simulations (Software) + 3D Camera-Projector Technology (Hardware).

<div>
The device runs a simulation of particles with autonomous agents behaviors which is projected with real-time graphics on top of physical building blocks using 3D camera-projector technology. The construction kit provides a playground for children to tinker with complex adaptive systems with their own hands by making spatial structures and transforming low-cost materials in computational artifacts on-the-fly. A tool to enable ludic and physical exploration of complex systems concepts like self-organization, emergence, decentralization, non-linearity, networks and adaptation.

<h5>
Example
</h5>

<div>
Children are around the hexagonal table. A bunch of building blocks lay on the surface. Juan, who is very curious, grabs a little tower and lots of tiny particles begin to flow resembling water or wind. The particles follow a nearby block trying to climb. Juan puts a strip on top and builds a path for the particles to move. Carmen grabs another strip and bifurcates the path made by Juan. She adds a platform and the particles start to accumulate! A graphical cue marks the area and a bar appears. It rises as the particles accumulate: it's measuring the flow! Sofia, who likes to make plans, puts an emitter, some attractors and proposes David to find a path to reach a block behind the obstacles. After a while they share their creation on the web platform.

<h5>
Impact
</h5>

<div>
  Outcome of the project:
  <ul>
    <li>The portable kit</li>
    <li>Hands-on workshops to learn complex systems concepts using the device</li>
    <li>Guides for workshop activities</li>
  </ul>
  This first iteration of workshops will be held on non-formal educational contexts for children from low income families in Buenos Aires. A workshop module covers 1 device/6 children/10 hours (TBD). It scales by replicating modules in sequence or parallel in time/space. Workshops will be documented with research purposes. The device and its activities encourage children to do the imagine-create-play-share-reflect cycle. It supports multiple cognitive styles and paths: free play for tinkerers, goals for planners, problem-solving for everyone. The physical relates to the digital at different levels: 1) Tangible blocks/digital simulation 2) Physical playground/online social platform.

<div>
The project can be applied on community centers, science museums, makerspaces, computer clubhouses as well as schools. The strategy is to begin with workshops on non-formal contexts on this first iteration. Thereafter expand to other contexts while iterating over design/implementation of device and workshop guides. To reach schools and insert the kit in formal curricula is a long-term goal. The primary goal is to spread the use of technology for playful creative tinkering to learn about complex adaptive systems.

Other robotic kits are usually used to make children repeat instructions to build a predefined robot (instructionism) rather than let children play creatively (constructionism). Apps for tablets is a big market, but only a few work with tangible interfaces aspects and the device is limited (individual rather than collaborative). None of the above overlap digital processes and physical materials.
