<p>This is a prototype for a visualization of the political and financial networks in Argentina. It's based on accountings submitted by political parties and electoral alliances. Here you can see 3 types of agents related:</p>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Private Contributors</p></li>
    <ul>
      <li><p><span style="background-color:#e7298a">People</span></p></li>
      <li><p><span style="background-color:#66a61e">Companies</span></p></li>
    </ul>
    <li><p>Money Receivers</p></li>
    <ul>
      <li><p><span style="background-color:#e6ab02">Political Groups</span></p></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</div>

<br>

<p>Each graph displays the biggest 400 contributors.</p>
<p>Node size represents the total amount of money contributed by a person or company to one or more political organizations.</p>

<p>How are our representative democracies working? How much democratic and representative are they if they depend on funding with highly concentrated origins? By whom and for whom are these democracies working? Are we living more on plutocracies rather than democracies?</p>

<br>

<p>Being a protoype there's a lot to fix and improve.</p>

<p>It's interesting to see how the composition of political funding is revealed, its structure and distribution of companies/people.</p>

<p>Besides qualitative analysis, at a quantitative level, the direct relation between amount of money available for parties and election results is also visible.</p>

<p>It's also interesenting to notice how certain nodes contribute to different groups acting as links between different clusters.</p>

<p>Better visual cues. Data checking. Add user parameters to filter by region, dates, quantities, etc...</p>

<br>

<p>...and here's a TED talk by Lawrence Lessig about these issues in the US</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a corruption at the heart of American politics, caused by the dependence of Congressional candidates on funding from the tiniest percentage of citizens. That's the argument at the core of this blistering talk by legal scholar Lawrence Lessig. With rapid-fire visuals, he shows how the funding process weakens the Republic in the most fundamental way, and issues a rallying bipartisan cry that will resonate with many in the U.S. and beyond.</p>
