<h3>Interaction Design. Creative Coding. Technology. Innovation.</h3>

<p>I build computational artifacts from an approach that values creative problem solving, collaboration and play. Tools based on interactions and usability for the development of human creativity, interpretation and expression. I work with iterative development cycles and prototyping practices to build knowledge from experience and quickly adapt to changing environments.</p>
