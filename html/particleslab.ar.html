<p>Concept.</p>

<p>
Particles-Lab is a low-cost mobile lab-in-a-box for people to tinker with complex adaptive systems through tangible-computation.

An interactive construction kit that projects an agent-based particle system simulation on top of physical building blocks using 3d camera-projector technology. 

A playground for people to build 3D structures in space with low-cost materials using their own hands and transform them into computational artifacts on-the-fly.

This learning tool enables physical and ludic exploration of complex systems concepts like self-organization, emergence, decentralized decision making, collective behaviors, non-linearity, networks, evolution and adaptation.

A tool for the development of human creativity, expression, computational thinking and learning that bridges the digital and physical worlds.

<p>Vision.</p>

<p>
There are low-cost laptops for children to learn computation, but they are based on the Personal Computer + GUI model. There's a need for a low-cost mobile device for children to learn Tangible-Computation.
