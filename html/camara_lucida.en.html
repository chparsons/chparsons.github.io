<p>
Camara Lucida explores the design and creation of computational artifacts that bridge the digital and physical worlds to make tools for the development of human creativity, expression, computational thinking and learning.
</p>

<p>
The project is based on the creation of digital construction kits that combine agent-based modeling and swarm intelligence with physical building blocks. Simulations of autonomous agents are projected on top of objects using 3d camera-projector technology.
</p>

<p>
Research is driven by prototyping playgrounds for people to tinker with complex adaptive processes through the construction of 3d structures in space with their own hands.
</p>

<p>
The goal is to make learning tools to enable physical, ludic and creative exploration of concepts related to agent-based systems and swarm intelligence, such as self-organization, emergence, decentralization, collective behaviors, non-linearity, networks, evolution and adaptation.

<p><strong>
The project has two branches:
</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>
Technology: development of a open-source software toolkit for artists, programmers and designers to make ludic interfaces and digital artifacts based on real-time projection mapping on physical objects. It uses a 3d Camera-Projector System to make a 3d representation of the scene and project graphics. https://github.com/chparsons
</li></p>

<li><p>
Interaction Design: what kinds of digital artifacts can be made with this tool, being design, art works, games, toys, learning tools, ...? How are the creative processes geared by the tool? What kind of interactions can be designed?
</li></p>
</ul>

<p><strong>Presentation at <a href="http://www.piksel.no/p11/presentations11#Parsons">Piksel '11</a></strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.piksel.no/about">Piksel</a> is an annual event for artists and developers working with free and open source software, hardware and art. Part workshop, part festival, it is organised in Bergen, Norway, and involves participants from more than a dozen countries exchanging ideas, coding, presenting art and software projects, doing workshops, performances and discussions on the aesthetics and politics of free and open source software.</p>
