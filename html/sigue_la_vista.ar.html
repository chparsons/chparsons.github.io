  "Each movement in weightlessness leads to a totally unexpected displacement. Movements are fluid and without end. You have the feeling that the movement began before its preparation and that it continues after it. That is why falling does not come into the equation, because, without willingly trying to, you cannot break or fall. You are not maintaining yourself in opposition to a force (gravity), but rather you let yourself be taken by the environment. [...] What is acting? Is it my body or the environment?"

Light sculpture made by a series of translucent acrilic layers that retain the light from a videoprojector. This is a technique I'm developing across several works and is aimed to transform light into matter that occupies space. It is a research on volumetric projections.

The image forms a floating body, suspended in space, with graphics generated on a computer based physics simulation. The physical interface is a wiimote. Its accelerometers sense the rotations performed by the users hands. Through these rotations the user can apply physical rotational forces to the simulated body, making it move inside this miniature environment.
</p>

<p>
The audio is composed by two sine oscillators. Each one of the two wave frequencies is controlled independently by a rotation aroud one of two axis in space: pitch and roll. This way, users can also control the sound paddling (the two waves interleaving to generate different degrees of interference) with their hand movements, adding another dimension of physical feedback.
