Description
</div>

<div>
"Puentes" is a computational construction kit for children to: learn about complex adaptive systems through tinkering and physical play with a simulation of particles and autonomous agents; develop creative problem-solving; and bridge the digital and physical worlds.

Problem
</div>

<div>
There are low-cost laptops for children to learn computation, but they are based on the personal computer (individual) and the GUI model (graphical user interface, purely digital, general purpose). Portable and low-cost devices are needed for children to develop creativity and systems thinking through Tangible-Computation based on a TUI model (tangible user interface, collaborative, hybrid physical-digital model of computation, special purpose).
</div>

<div>
Solution
</div>

<div>
A portable interactive construction kit made by the combination of: Physical Building Blocks + Autonomous Agents Simulations + 3D Camera-Projector Technology. The device runs a simulation of particles with autonomous agents behaviors which is projected with real-time graphics on top of physical building blocks using 3D camera-projector technology. The construction kit provides a playground for children to tinker with complex adaptive systems with their own hands by making spatial structures and transforming low-cost materials in computational artifacts on-the-fly. A tool to enable ludic and physical exploration of complex systems concepts like self-organization, emergence, decentralization, non-linearity, networks and adaptation.

Example
</div>

<div>
Children are around a table. A bunch of building blocks lay on the surface. Pepe, who is very curious, grabs a little tower and lots of tiny little particles start to flow from the tower resembling water or maybe wind. They follow a nearby block trying to climb. Pepe puts a strip on top and builds a path for the particles to move. Carmen grabs another strip and bifurcates the path made by Pepe. Then she adds a platform and the particles start to accumulate! A graphical cue marks that point and a bar appears. As the particles accumulate the bar rises. It's measuring the flow! Sofia, who likes to make plans, puts an emitter, some attractors and proposes David to make a path to reach a block behind the obstacles.

Impact
</div>

<div>
The device lets children do the imagine-create-play-share-reflect cycle. It supports multiple cognitive styles and paths: free play for tinkerers, goals for planners, problem-solving for everyone. The physical is linked to the digital at different levels: 1) Blocks operate on particles changing their simple agent rules and the interactions between particles. The system output changes to let self-organization, emergent behaviors, decentralized decision making, non-linearity and other concepts be explored. 2) Children share their creations from the playground to an online social platform. The web displays snapshots of structures with the flowing particles. People share spatial problems for others to solve, crazy sets, etc. 3) The tables are hexagonal so they can be connected on many arrangements. Particles interact along tables and children construct structures at different spatial levels.

Full impact potential
</div>

<div>
Portability lets the kit be used on guided workshops to learn complex systems concepts. On community centers, science museums, hackerspaces, computer clubhouses as well as schools. The strategy is to start with workshops on non-formal educational contexts when having a first iteration of the device and workshop guides. Thereafter expand to other contexts while iterating over design/implementation. To reach school and insert the kit in formal curricula is a long-term goal. The primary goal is to spread the use of technology for playful creative tinkering to learn about complex adaptive systems.

Marketplace
</div>

<div>
StarLogo works with complex systems but it's purely software tool. LegoMindstorms works with physical computing but doesn't address emergent behaviors from lots of agents interacting with simple rules. Other robotic kits are usually used to make children repeat instructions to build a predefined robot (instructionism) rather than let children play creatively (constructionism). Apps for tablets is a big market, but only a few work with tangible interfaces aspects and the device is limited (individual rather than collaborative). None of the above overlap digital processes and physical materials.

Sustainability Plan
</div>

<div>
Revenue based on distribution of devices to a range of contexts: For-profit: educational institutions like schools, science museums, end-user's homes (as an educational game device, taking a similar place as commercial game consoles). Government: implementation on formal institutions through public educational plans. Citizen sector: non-formal contexts like community centers, hackerspaces or computer clubhouses through donations or crowfunding.
